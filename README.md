# Vanilla JS: Color Suggester

About this app:

Color Suggester is a lightweight practice Vanilla JavaScript application designed to assist users in exploring and selecting colours.

What does it do?

-   Given an input colour, which must be either an existing HTML, HEX or RGB colour, it displays some shades and hues of that colour along with some harmonious combinations to go with that colour.
-   It also displays a selection of random colours.
-   And allows you to save colours to Your Favourites (and view them later).

The app focuses on simplicity, interactivity, and efficient colour representation.

Technologies used: the MVC project architecture with the Subscriber-Publisher pattern, ES6 classes, modularising, async/await, fetch, [external API](https://github.com/joshbeckman/thecolorapi), localStorage, SCSS, Webpack module bundler.
